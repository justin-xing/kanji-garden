# Kanji Garden
TLDR: *A minimalist Kanji learning app that helps you build, visualize, and store your own personalized mnemonics with the help of AI!*

Kanji Garden is a Japanese learning app designed to make kanji feel less intimidating and more personal. The app pairs language learning with a virtual plant that grows with the user’s understanding, using stories, patterns, and visual associations to support memorization and recall. By breaking each kanji character into meaningful pieces and generating personalized stories and images using AI, Kanji Garden helps learners build deeper connections with each character rather than relying on rote memorization. The app aims to create a more engaging, human-centered way to learn kanji — one that adapts to individual interpretation and supports long-term retention.

Built as a part of https://uwfutureslab.ca, an AI prototyping workshop held in partnership between the **University of Waterloo** and **Google**.
